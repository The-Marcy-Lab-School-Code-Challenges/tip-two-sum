### Problem (edit `index.js`)
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

- You may assume each input has exactly one solution.
- You may not use the same element twice.
- Return the answer in any order.

### Examples

Example 1:

```txt
Input:  nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1]
Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, so return [0, 1].
```

Example 2:

```txt
Input:  nums = [3, 2, 4], target = 6
Output: [1, 2]
```

Example 3:

```txt
Input:  nums = [3, 3], target = 6
Output: [0, 1]
```
